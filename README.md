# NumberGuesser

Basic number guessing game built in vanilla JavaScript.

The game is to allow you to guess a number between 1 and 10.
A right answer gives you green border and text, a wrong answer, red.
You are only allowed three attempts at guessing the right answer.
We are to use 'Skeleton' for the U.I.

This number guessing game is coded in HTML, a U.I. built with 'Skeleton', and in vanilla JavaScript.
It was built in four parts:
1. Build the U.I.
2. Validating the architecture of the game and 'winning' case.
3. Building out the 'lose' case, and the 'game over' sections.
4. Making it smoother to play again, and then randomising the 'winning number', dynamically changing based on changing values of the minimum and maximum allowed.
